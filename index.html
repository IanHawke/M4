You thought particle physics and astronomy were the only big frontiers in physics?
 Well, you thought wrong. Follow this blog to start discovering some of the wonders
  of materials all around you, and some of the revolutions that are shocking the field.</p>

<p>Posts are converted jupyter notebooks with Julia code, and are meant for interaction.
For additional information, see <a href="{{base.url}}/M4/jupyterjulia">Interact</a>.</p>

<p>
So before you start a post, how might you figure out if it will be understandable for your background?
That's where my categories come in.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b style="color: #6d084c">General Audience:</b> Those with some background in programming, math, and physics should be able to follow.</li>
  <li><b style="color: #6d084c">Prerequisites Required:</b> I will spell out classes that one should have taken
    in order to understand the physics of the post.  For example, in order to understand calculating
     the orbitals of a hydrogen-like atom, I will assume you analytically solved the hydrogen atom in a Quantum Mechanics course.
   Even if you haven't taken  the classes, feel free to still look at the posts.  </li>
  <li><b style="color: #6d084c">Graduate:</b> Advanced Courses are recommended in order to get the most out of the material. That being said, I
    try to avoid assuming knowledge of vocabulary or notation. I want to bridge the gap between written descriptions of
    algorithms and full fledged research implementations here.</li>
  <li><b style="color: #6d084c">Numerics:</b>Without a specific physics goal.  Sometimes I may just want to talk about something programming or
    numerical method related.</li>
  <li><b style="color: #6d084c">Programming:</b>Assorted Julialang topics not to do with numbers.</li>
</ul>
