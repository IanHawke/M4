If I'm teaching just one student, I can see how they respond to instruction and tailor what I say to suit their needs.  If they're struggling somewhere, I can spend more time on one particular topic. I could chose a specific area that ignites their passion.  When teaching for a classroom of 20, I would have to change tactics.  I could still tailor instruction a little bit, but I would focus toward the group, and perhaps periodically herd the outliers.  I might still know everyone's name and give detailed feedback, even if I couldn't tailor the pace to one person.

The methodology would change again once I switched to a grand lecture hall filled with 1,000 people.

I no longer see people, but a sea of bodies washed out by stage lights.  Now I might particularily notice the person whose cell phone keeps going off, or the person who keeps asking me questions, but instead of people, I get a background + outliers.

We perform this same thing when looking at materials.  Many physicists spend their entire careers just looking at 1, 2, or 3 particles, and that those systems pose an incredible number of challenges and interesting phenomena.  Metals, magnets, or any material really, deals with so many particles that not only do we have to change how we approach the problem, the solutions are completely different.  Significantly different behavior emerges from a large number of interacting particles than from just one or two.

This also happens with people as well.  People in mobs will commit acts that they never would individually.  Understanding one person is not the same as understanding twitter or Reddit.

The most profound example of particles behaving differently because of large numbers is symmetry breaking.  As discussed in "Phase Transitions", one particle might have a symmetry, like translation or rotation, but the material composed of those particles doesn't. One pair of dancers can move around the floor in any way they please, but when many dancers enter the floor, everyone needs to choose a convention of circling clockwise or circling counter-clockwise.  Or dancing a style where you stay put.

 In translational symmetry, every position in space is equivalent.  One nucleus won't care if it's located at 0, .1, $\pi$, or 1099.243 .  The laws of physics still look the same at each position.   When we add a model has a large number of nuclei bonded into a solid, they will all arrange a set distance from each other.  If you want to move one nucleus .1 units, you would have to move all of the nuclei .1 units, which takes an extensively large amount of energy.  So in the material, we actually can't just go around arbitrarily moving nuclei.  One position ends up being special.

Let's head back to the teaching example.  Part of the metaphor relates to the fact that we have to approach many particles differently, but the metaphor also gives some insight into how we deal with the problem of many particles.  When dealing with a near infinite number of electrons, instead of treating them like individuals, we wash them out into just a sea and only deal with the outliers, like the person on their phone of the one waving the sign in the first row.  These outliers are called "quasi-particles", or things that are behaving like particles.

Traffic convoys best exemplify "quasi-particles".  On a highway, cars tend to bunch up, with dense areas of cars and sparse areas in between.  Instead of specifying where each car was one the highway, I could specify the location of convoy quasi-particles of charge n.  They enter and leave the freeway mostly like cars do and move down the freeway mostly the same way cars do.  The equations of motion would have to be slightly altered, but the qualitative description would be the same.  The quasiparticles of electrons and holes in metals behave much like free electrons qualitatively, but the equations of motion do just get a little altered.

Wow, I can write posts much faster if I don't have to worry about varible types and semicolons ;)
