## Metals, Magnets, and Miscelaneous Materials: Blog Introduction to Comptational Condensed Matter

You thought particle physics and astronomy were the only big fronteirs in physics? Well, you thought wrong.  
Follow this blog to start discovering some of the wonders of materials all around you, and some of the revolutions that are shocking the field. 

I will vary the level from undergraduate physics major to graduate student in field.  I still encourage the curious layperson to give some a try.  Later, I will develop a difficulty ranking scheme.

The blog will be written in the form of julia (http://julialang.org/) jupyter notebooks. This new language has a syntax similiar to Matlab or Python, and is easily human readable.  I encourage active participation by manipulating the code.

You can either install Julia and jupyter notebook on your own machine, or use juliabox (https://www.juliabox.org/) to view and interact with the files.  

To use juliabox (the easiest option), log in with a google account, and then click on the sync tab.  Under the Github directory, input the clone https://github.com/albi3ro/M4.git , use branch master, and name the folder as you see fit.  

Check out http://julialang.org/ for documentation on this new and exciting language, and learn how to install it on your own machine.
