@article{Kohmoto1985a,
abstract = {The topological aspects of wavefunctions for electrons in a two dimensional periodic potential with a magnetic field are discussed. Special attention is paid to the linear response formula for the Hall conductance $\sigma$xy. It is shown that the quantized value of $\sigma$xyis related to the number of zeros of wavefunctions in the magnetic Brillouin zone. A phase of wavefunctions cannot be determined in a unique and smooth way over the entire magnetic Brillouin zone unless the magnetic subband carries no Hall current. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

@article{Simon1983,
abstract = {It is shown that the "geometrical phase factor" recently found by Berry in his study of the quantum adiabatic theorem is precisely the holonomy in a Hermitian line bundle since the adiabatic theorem naturally defines a connection in such a bundle. This not only takes the mystery out of Berry's phase factor and provides calculational simple formulas, but makes a connection between Berry's work and that of Thouless et al. This connection allows the author to use Berry's ideas to interpret the integers of Thouless et al. in terms of eigenvalue degeneracies.},

@article{Berry1984,
abstract = {M. V. BerryAbstract A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}R{\}}{\$} in its Hamiltonian {\$}\backslashhat{\{}H{\}}(\backslashmathrm{\{}R{\}}){\$}, will acquire a geometrical phase factor {\$}\backslashexp {\{}i\backslashgamma(\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}){\}}{\$} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of {\$}\backslashhat{\{}H{\}}(\backslashmathbf{\{}R{\}}){\$} over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of {\$}\backslashhat{\{}H{\}}, \backslashgamma{\$}(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},
