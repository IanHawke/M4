    "I've been trying to learn the pure math side of topology to understand topological materials better.   Predictably, my sources have a lot of theorems, the examples tend to be esoteric and hard to conceptualize, and I have little idea how it all relates to my pretty crystals.  There also aren't that many examples.  I almost miss the days back in high school when they forced us to do the same problem 1,000 times over.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So to better understand one of the important topics, simplices and simplicial complexes, I've decided to take the pure math and put it to programming the best that I can.  I don't know if this is the best way of doing things, or if it's useful at all, but I think it helps me understand them.  Hopefully, it will help you too.\n",

    "<b>Homology</b> is the study of deforming things.  If we push and pull at something, without tearing or gluing, what properties remain the same?  A coffee cup is the same as a donut because they both have one hole.  \n",

    "Many objects of interest are <b>topologies</b>, which are just collections of sets that obey certain constraints.  Every manifold you've ever worked with has been a topology, but it probably was just trivial and didn't need further study.  To study more complex topologies, we can find an equivalent <b>simplicial complex</b>.  We can then compute a variety of things about the simplicial complex that tell us about the properties of the topology.  \n",
