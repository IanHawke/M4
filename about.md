## Me!
I'm a PhD student at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate Uinveristy studying Quantum Spin Liquids,
a subset of Frustration, a subset of Condensed Matter Physics.

I would greatly like to thank Lee J. O'Riordan, (Github: [mlxd](https://github.com/mlxd)), for conversations, advice, and the large amount of grammar checking this physicist needs.
