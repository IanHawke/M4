Lattice Types
* Chain
* Square
* Honeycomb
* Checkerboard


Once a lattice is created, it contains <b>Members of Type</b>:
* `name`, a string
* `l`, length in number of unit cells
* `dim`, dimension of lattice
* `a`, array containing the basis vectors by which positions are generated
* `unit`, array of positions inside a single unit
* `N`, number of total sites
* `X`, array of positions
* `nnei`, number of nearest neighbors
* `neigh`, Array of nearest neighbors [i][j], where i is site and j is 1:nnei
